Unfortunately, I can't distribute the raw data for this, but you can obtain it from [CQ Press](http://library.cqpress.com/elections/download-data.php?filetype=&office=1&areatype=2&year=1976&format=4&license=on&emailto=&emailfrom=) and [ICPSR](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/8611) if you have access to those sites.

Put the extract the data to `./data` and  run `Rscript bellwether.R`
